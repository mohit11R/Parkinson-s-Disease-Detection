# Parkinson-s-Disease-Detection

### Problem Statement

With the advancements in our modern and technological lifestyle, more and more people
are busy with their work and not taking seriousness on their health. Today, many people are
suffering from various diseases, and Parkinson’s Disease is also one of them. Parkinson’s
Disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement leading to shaking,
stiffness, and difficulty with walking, balance, and coordination. Parkinson’s Symptoms
usually begin gradually and get worse over time. So, in this Project, we will predict whether a
person is healthy or have Parkinson disease with features like Average vocal fundamental
frequency, Maximum vocal fundamental frequency, etc.

### Database Analyzing, design and implementation

• The used Dataset is a Parkinson’s Disease available on Kaggle Website.

• All the Analysis, Visualization and Implementation of the data has been done in Anaconda environment using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

• Key aspects of the dataset or feature
1. Average vocal fundamental frequency
2. Minimum vocal fundamental frequency
3. Maximum vocal fundamental frequency
4. Several measures of variation in fundamental frequency
5. NHR, HNR - Two measures of ratio of noise to tonal components in the voice
6. Two nonlinear dynamical complexity measures

• Now, EDA process starts to analysis data to get better Insight such as correlation, Description, missing Values etc.

• After the EDA process, some missing values are replaced by mean value.

• Using Feature Engineering new feature are added to get better data to predict.

• Then, Dimensionality Reduction and Scaling data was done because to predict it fast.

• Data is set to build machine learning models and visualizing Confusion matrix Graph

Building Machine Learning Models –

          i. Linear Regression
          ii. Logistic Regression
          iii. Decision Tree
          iv. Random Forest tree
          v. Support Vector Machine
          vi. XGboost
          
• Making a pickle file of Best Accuracy Machine learning models to predict.

• Building Flask App using different function to call to collecting data and predicted that.

• Attaching Html and CSS with Flask to have UI to use for users.
